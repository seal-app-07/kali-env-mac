# Container Edition — Kali on macOS Virtualization.framework

> ⚠️ About AI-generated content  
> This README and scripts were drafted/augmented with AI. Behavior may differ due to environment (macOS/Virtualization.framework, XQuartz, network layout) or exam policy changes. Review before use and pull requests/issues are welcome.

**Use case:** lightweight daily labs (HTB/THM). GUI is X11 via XQuartz + socat.  
VPN runs on the host (macOS) and is shared to the container via pf/NAT.

---

## Why a “container edition”? (Background / Goals)

- **Fast & lightweight:** quicker than booting a full VM, no snapshots, easy throw-away runs (`ckali-clean`)
- **Consistency:** uses the official Kali image as-is (`docker.io/kalilinux/kali-rolling:latest`)
- **Work around constraints:** Virtualization.framework makes in-container TUN/TAP difficult → policy: run VPN on the host and share it via pf NAT
- **GUI support:** bridge the XQuartz UNIX socket to :6000/TCP with socat, then `DISPLAY=<host>:0`

🧭 **When to use which:**
- Practice / learning: this container edition (snappy, reproducible)
- Exams / heavy tooling: the VM edition (OpenVPN runs inside Kali; better for kernel/driver needs)

---

## Requirements & Assumptions

- macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel)
- The Virtualization.framework container CLI is available (`container --version`)
- Homebrew installed
- XQuartz for X11 display, socat for bridging

### Install (example)

```sh
brew install --cask xquartz
brew install socat openvpn
# Start the container runtime if it’s not running
container system start
```

---

## Setup (Overview)

1. Merge `container/zshrc` into your `~/.zshrc` (avoid clobbering existing settings)
2. Install xquartz, socat, openvpn via Homebrew
3. Use `ckali` for persistent usage, `ckali-clean` for clean runs, and `burp-light` for Burp GUI

---

## Quick Start

```sh
# 1) Launch persistent Kali (with X11 bridge)
ckali

# 2) Test GUI (inside the container)
xeyes  # or xclock

# 3) Connect VPN on the host (OpenVPN, etc.)
#    You should see a utunX interface

# 4) Share the VPN to the container
vpn-share-on

# 5) Receive a reverse shell (default 1234/TCP)
nc -lvnp 1234   # inside the container
# Payload LHOST = your utunX inet (10.x.x.x), LPORT=1234

# Cleanup
vpn-share-off
```

---

## Directories & Persistence

- `~/pentest/root` → mounts to the container’s `/root` (your workspace)
- **Optional APT cache persistence:** enable with `APT_PERSIST=1`
    - `~/pentest/apt-cache` → `/var/cache/apt`
    - `~/pentest/apt-lists` → `/var/lib/apt/lists`

---

## What’s in .zshrc (Design / Rationale / Usage)

This documents each function/alias shipped in `.zshrc` — with purpose, background, usage, and safety.

### 0) Safe tmux attach (interactive shells only)

```sh
if [[ $- == *i* ]] && command -v tmux >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  if ! tmux has-session -t works 2>/dev/null; then
    tmux new -ds works
  fi
  [ -z "$TMUX" ] && tmux attach -t works
fi
```
- Purpose: auto-attach to tmux on interactive shell start (reuse works if it exists)
- Safety: no effect in non-interactive shells; does nothing if already inside tmux

### 1) PATH

```sh
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/homebrew/opt/openvpn/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin"
```
- Purpose: ensure Homebrew’s OpenVPN and XQuartz tools (e.g., xhost) are on PATH

### 2) Cleanup for idempotency

```sh
# Clear existing aliases/functions so re-sourcing doesn’t double-define
for a in ...; do unalias "$a" 2>/dev/null; done
unset -f ... 2>/dev/null
unset _tool_bootstrap 2>/dev/null
```
- Purpose: make `.zshrc` safe to re-load repeatedly without stacking definitions

### 3) Host IP resolver: _host_ip

```sh
_host_ip() { ipconfig getifaddr en0 || ipconfig getifaddr en1 || printf "127.0.0.1"; }
```
- Purpose: quickly get the host LAN IP for `DISPLAY=<host_ip>:0`
- Note: tries en0 then en1 (wired vs Wi-Fi differs by machine)

### 4) X11 bridge: _x11_bridge_up / x11_up / x11_down

```sh
_x11_bridge_up() {
  # Start XQuartz → read launchd DISPLAY → bridge to :6000/TCP with socat
  # Finally run: xhost +   (allow all; consider tightening)
}
x11_up(){ _x11_bridge_up; export DISPLAY="$(_host_ip):0"; }
x11_down(){ xhost - ; pkill -f 'socat TCP-LISTEN:6000' ; }
```
- Purpose: expose XQuartz’s UNIX socket on :6000/TCP so the container can draw GUI
- Security: `xhost +` is permissive; prefer `xhost +LOCAL:` or a specific host if possible
- Testing: `xeyes` / `xclock` (installed in the container via x11-apps)

### 5) APT cache persistence: __apt_vols

- Purpose: reduce apt update/upgrade time across runs
- Behavior: when `APT_PERSIST=1`, mount `~/pentest/apt-*` to apt cache/list paths; auto-disables if unwritable

### 6) In-container bootstrap: _tool_bootstrap

- Runs once per container (`/root/.kali_bootstrapped` flag)
- Installs (high-level):
    - Core tooling: tmux, zsh, build-essential, python3 (+ venv, pipx), golang-go, jq
    - Recon/Web: whatweb, wafw00f, nikto, sqlmap
    - Wordlists/dirs: seclists, wordlists, gobuster, ffuf, feroxbuster, dirb
    - Network: nmap, masscan, amass, proxychains4, tcpdump, iproute2, dnsutils, netcat-traditional, socat, openvpn
    - SMB/AD: smbclient, smbmap, enum4linux-ng, python3-impacket, ldap-utils, crackmapexec, responder
    - Attack frameworks: metasploit-framework, exploitdb, sshuttle, chisel, mitmproxy
    - GUI sanity: x11-apps, fonts-noto (for Japanese rendering)
    - Java/Burp: openjdk-21-jre, burpsuite; also adds Temurin 21 repo as fallback and fetches the Burp community JAR if needed
    - Network repair: `/usr/local/bin/net-repair` to restore default route/DNS manually
    - MTU/PMTU tweaks: enable PMTU probing to avoid VPN-path stalls
    - `burp-light` wrapper: auto-selects a working Java and runs Burp with HOME redirected to `/mnt/burp-profile` so your settings are persisted separately.

---

## Container lifecycle functions

- **ckali (persistent):**
    - Purpose: keep `/root` on the host for day-to-day continuity
    - Behavior: _tool_bootstrap runs only the first time; subsequent runs reuse the environment
- **ckali-clean (throw-away):**
    - Purpose: ephemeral runs; no persistent volumes
- **ckali-exec / ckali-rm:**
    - exec: open another shell into the existing ckali-persist
    - rm: remove ckali-persist and clean `~/pentest/{root,apt-cache,apt-lists,burp-profile}`

---

## Helper info functions

- `_kali_ip`: fetch IPv4 of the container’s eth0 (used as RDR destination)
- `_vpn_utun`: detect the host utunX that has a 10.x.* address (OpenVPN/Tunnelblick)

---

## VPN sharing via pf/NAT

**Design intent:**
- Containers on Virtualization.framework can’t reliably use TUN/TAP → run VPN on the host
- Use NAT + RDR to achieve both utunX → (NAT) → container and utunX:1234 → container:1234

**Rule ordering matters:**
- Apply translation (rdr, nat) before filtering (pass)
- Do not disturb Apple’s anchors; use our own anchor `com.pentest.vpnshare` and only swap rules there

**Base setup: _ensure_pf_base**
- `set skip on lo0`
- Keep com.apple/* anchors
- Create empty com.pentest.vpnshare anchors (we load rules into this anchor)

**ON/OFF/RESET:**
- vpn-share-on: detect utun, get Kali IP, load rdr pass + nat + pass out into our anchor, then enable `net.inet.ip.forwarding=1`
- vpn-share-off: clear only our anchor and restore the base (pf remains enabled)
- vpn-share-reset: disable pf and restore defaults (last resort)

> 🔎 Note: if you see pf-panic-reset referenced elsewhere, the implementation is unified as vpn-share-reset here (equivalent behavior).

**Convenience:**
- vpn-share-status: show `pfctl -sr/-sn`, our anchor’s rules, and ip.forwarding
- rshell-open: quick RDR for TCP/1234 (override with VPN_RPORT)
- kali-set-mtu <MTU>: set container eth0 MTU (helps with VPN path issues)

---

## Hints & runtime startup

- Show a one-time usage hint on first load (`ZSHRC_KALI_HINT_SHOWN` prevents repeats)
- Run `container system start` so the runtime is up even if it was down

---

## Security Considerations

- **X11:** `xhost +` is too permissive; prefer `xhost +LOCAL:` or `xhost +<YourHostIP>`. You can also bind socat to 127.0.0.1 only.
- **pf rules:** vpn-share-on exposes TCP/1234 by default (minimum necessary); adjust via VPN_RPORT.
- **Root privileges:** pfctl / sysctl require sudo.
- **Network repair:** use net-repair (inside the container) to restore default GW/DNS if needed.

---

## Typical HTB/THM Workflow

1. Connect VPN on the host (OpenVPN, etc.) → confirm utunX with `ifconfig | grep utun`
2. `ckali` → verify GUI with `xeyes`
3. `vpn-share-on` → from the container, run `curl ifconfig.io` to verify the route
4. Reverse shell: `nc -lvnp 1234` (container) / payload LHOST=<utun inet> LPORT=1234
5. When done: `vpn-share-off` → `exit` (container)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No GUI appears**
    - Start XQuartz (`open -a XQuartz`), confirm socat listening on :6000:
    - `lsof -n -iTCP:6000 -sTCP:LISTEN`
    - Ensure DISPLAY is `<host_ip>:0` (`echo $DISPLAY`)
- **No Internet from the container**
    - Run net-repair inside the container to restore default route/DNS
    - Try MTU tuning: `kali-set-mtu 1400`
- **VPN sharing not working**
    - Confirm utunX detection; run vpn-share-status to see RDR/NAT loaded
    - Check `sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding` equals 1
    - If rules conflict, vpn-share-reset → re-apply
- **Reverse shell drops/stalls**
    - Lower MTU (`kali-set-mtu 1400`)
    - Ensure LHOST is the utunX inet (10.x)

---

## Maintenance / Cleanup

- Remove everything persistent: `ckali-rm` (container + ~/pentest directories)
- Fully restore pf: `vpn-share-reset` (last resort)

---

## FAQ

- **Q. Why not run OpenVPN inside the container?**  
  A. Virtualization.framework containers don’t reliably support TUN/TAP, so OpenVPN is unstable there. Running VPN on the host and sharing via pf is safer and simpler.

- **Q. How do I harden X11?**  
  A. Use `xhost +LOCAL:` or `xhost +<YourHostIP>`, and bind socat to 127.0.0.1 only.

- **Q. Change the RDR port?**  
  A. Use an env var: `VPN_RPORT=4444 vpn-share-on`.

---

## Operations Policy

- `.zshrc` prioritizes idempotency and reversibility (safe to re-source anytime)
- pf operations touch only our own anchor; Apple default anchors remain intact
- Keep GUI forwarding & VPN sharing at least privilege (turn off with `vpn-share-off` / `x11_down` when not needed)
